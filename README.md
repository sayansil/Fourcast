# ABSTRACT

### For problem statement 4
-----

Keeping in mind that **235 million** individuals over the planet suffer from *Chronic respiratory diseases* (CRDs) and over **3 million** of them die from *chronic obstructive pulmonary disease* (COPD), we have put forward an approach to spread medical awareness by letting the public visualize and know how polluted the air is, around their home or workplace.


The primary goal is to let a person become **scientifically and medically aware** of the pollutants that could harm them so that they could take neessary precautions before its too late for them. We have targeted the user base of Android mobile phones by creating an **Android Application** that could aptly suit our needs. The Android Application, referred to as "app" here on, will provide a **real time** and **interactive interface** to an individual who can check for the polution indices of various pollutants in his locality, or any location he chooses to. The app not only provide a raw pollutant level information, but also **suggest precautionary measures** to avoid any respiratory inconvinience during the day. 

The app shall also **warn** the user periodically if a pollutant concentration gets **dangerously high**, via a convenient *notification* on their phone, upon seeing which the user can interact with it to know more. 

The bottomline remains: 
> ***Providing right information at the right time to make our users medically conscious and aware.***


We have made use of the [AQICN](https://aqicn.org/api/) and [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/
) APIs to get the necessary information to be displayed on the app.
